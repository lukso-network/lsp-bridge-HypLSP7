This repo is the LSP7 version of the [`HypERC20`] and [`HypERC20Collateral`] of `@hyperlane-xyz/core` package. They are
used to bridge tokens between the Ethereum and LUKSO chains using the
[Hashi Bridge](https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi).

> More details about the bridge **architecture and token bridging flow** in the [**`docs/`**](./docs/README.md) folder.

### Examples of bridged tokens

## Getting Started

This project is based on the Foundry template by PaulRBerg.

```sh
bun install # install Solhint, Prettier, and other Node.js deps
```

If this is your first time with Foundry, check out the
[installation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) instructions.

### Installing Dependencies

Foundry typically uses git submodules to manage dependencies, but this template uses Node.js packages because
[submodules don't scale](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1736695487057531328).

This is how to install dependencies:

1. Install the dependency using your preferred package manager, e.g. `bun install dependency-name`
   - Use this syntax to install from GitHub: `bun install github:username/repo-name`
2. Add a remapping for the dependency in [remappings.txt](./remappings.txt), e.g.
   `dependency-name=node_modules/dependency-name`

Note that OpenZeppelin Contracts is pre-installed, so you can follow that as an example.

### Sensible Defaults

This template comes with a set of sensible default configurations for you to use. These defaults can be found in the
following files:

```text
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solhint.json
├── foundry.toml
└── remappings.txt
```

## Usage

This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build & Compile

```sh
# Build the contracts:
forge build

# Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:
forge clean

# Get a test coverage report:
forge coverage

# Format the contracts:
forge fmt

# Get a gas report:
forge test --gas-report

# Lint the contracts:
bun run lint

# Run the tests:
forge test

# Generate test coverage and output result to the terminal:
bun run test:coverage

# Generate test coverage with lcov report (you'll have to open the `./coverage/index.html` file in your browser,
# to do so simply copy paste the path):
bun run test:coverage:report
```

### GitHub Actions

This repository uses pre-configured GitHub Actions. The contracts are linted and tested on every push and pull requests.
You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).
